# clockblind

This project is a mapping prototype that explores spatial anomalies using the `occult_anomalies.csv` dataset. It serves as a sandbox for data exploration, transformation, and visualization experiments.

## Features

* Example CSV dataset for mapping exercises (`occult_anomalies.csv`).
* Placeholder scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization (to be added).
* Clear structure ready for extension with mapping or geospatial code.

## Setup

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/OliPopTX/clockblind.git`

Then inspect the `occult_anomalies.csv` file using your preferred data analysis tool (Python, Excel, etc.). If future scripts are added, set up a Python virtual environment and install any required packages.

## Usage

Use the `occult_anomalies.csv` data to practice building maps, charts, or other visualizations. As the project grows, notebooks or scripts for geospatial analysis will be added here.
